Asynchronous JavaScript, AJAX, and APIs

*So far, most of our code is synchronous, and synchronous code is executed line by line in the exact order of execution that we define in the code.

*Alert statement is an example of Long-running operation that blocks code execution.


Asynchronous
- Asynchronous code is executed after a task that runs in the "background" finishes.

- Asynchronous code is non-blocking

- Execution doesn't wait for an asynchronous task to finish its work.

- Coordinating behavior of a program over a period of time. (Not occuring at the same time)

- Callback functions alone do not make code asynchronous

Ex.

img.src = 'dog.jpg'; -> This code is asynchronous because the code will not stop and wait for the image to load.

- addEventListener does not automatically make code asynchronous.

- Other examples: Geolocation API or AJAX calls.


What are AJAX Calls?
Asynchronous Javascript And XML: Allows us to communicate with remote web servers in an asynchronous way. With AJAX calls, we can request data from web servers dynamically.


What is an API?
Application Programming Interface: Piece of software that can be used by another piece of software, in order to allow applications to talk to each other.

- There are many types of APIs in web development
    +DOM API / +Geolocation API / +Own Class API /+Online API (just API)

- "Online" API: Application running on a server, that receives requests for data, and sends data back as response.

- We can build our own web APIs (requires back-end development, e.g with node.js) or use 3rd-party APIs.
    + There is an API for everything
        Ex. Weather data
            Data about countries
            Flights data
            Currency conversion data
            APIs for sending email or SMS
            Google Maps

* No API uses XML anymore, instead JSON data format is now commonly used.
